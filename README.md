# Morse Code Reader
<sup>Undegrad project 2019</sup>

In this project, an Arduino Uno board was used to interpret Morse Code from a push button. As the user inputs dots (short press) and dashes (long press) using the button, the entries are intrepreted by the program in real-time and displayed on an LCD screen.

A separate push button allows the user to erase characters from the screen (backspace).
